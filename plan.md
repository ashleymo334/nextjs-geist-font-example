4. **Responsive Design**: Clean, professional UI that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Step-by-Step Changes

#### 1. Create a New Page for Language Practice
- **File**: `src/app/language-practice.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Create a new functional component for the language practice page.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Implement a layout that includes a header, main content area, and footer.

#### 2. Implement Language Selection
- **File**: `src/components/ui/select.tsx` (or create a new component if necessary)
- **Changes**:
  - Create a dropdown for language selection.
  - Use state management to handle the selected language.

#### 3. Create Interactive Activities
- **Files**: Create separate components for each activity type in `src/components/ui/`.
  - **Quizzes**: `quiz.tsx`
  - **Matching Games**: `matching-game.tsx`
  - **Conversation Simulations**: `conversation-simulation.tsx`
  - **Fill-in-the-blank Exercises**: `fill-in-the-blank.tsx`
  - **Flashcards**: `flashcards.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Each component should handle its own state and logic for the respective activity.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling and ensure accessibility.

#### 4. Add Navigation
- **File**: `src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Update the navigation menu to include a link to the new language practice page.

#### 5. Implement Error Handling
- **Files**: Throughout the application
- **Changes**:
  - Ensure that all components handle errors gracefully, providing user feedback when necessary (e.g., invalid input, network errors).

#### 6. Testing
- **Files**: Create test files alongside each component (e.g., `quiz.test.tsx`)
- **Changes**:
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library to write tests for rendering, interaction, and accessibility.

### UI/UX Considerations
- The design should be clean and professional, focusing on usability.
- Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible and provide feedback on user actions.
- Use responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on all devices.

### Image Implementation
- No images are required for this application as per the current specifications.

### Summary
- A new language practice page will be created in `src/app/language-practice.tsx`.
- Language selection and interactive activities will be implemented as separate components in `src/components/ui/`.
- Navigation will be updated to include the new page.
- Error handling will be integrated throughout the application.
- Testing will be conducted using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure functionality and accessibility. 

This plan outlines the necessary steps to create the TalkBridge application, ensuring a modern, responsive, and user-friendly experience for language learners.
